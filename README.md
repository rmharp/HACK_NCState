# Hack_NCState: The Cycle of Life Project

This innovative project, "The Cycle of Life," aims to encompass the various stages of life, offering tools, insights, and interactive experiences that highlight the journey from birth to aging. Our team is passionate about creating a software artifact that not only educates but also provides meaningful engagement with users through the lens of neuroscience and behavioral studies.

## Project Overview

"The Cycle of Life" project is inspired by the hackathon theme of exploring life's various stages, from birth to aging, through an innovative and interactive lens. Our motivation stems from a desire to demystify the complexities of life's journey, providing users with a unique window into how changes in the brain can affect behavior throughout different life stages. 

Objectives include:
- Educating users on the neuroscience behind life stages.
- Providing interactive experiences that simulate the effects of adjusting specific brain regions.
- Showcasing the impact of these adjustments on behavior and development.

Our project uniquely addresses the hackathon theme by focusing on the neuroscience aspect of life's cycle, utilizing technologies and methodologies such as simulation software, interactive brain models, and data analytics to create an engaging and educational experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Life Stages Experiences:** Users can explore various stages of life through simulations that highlight the impact of different brain regions on behavior.
  
- **Educational Content:** Detailed explanations of each brain region (parietal lobe, hypothalamus, frontal lobe, cerebellum, occipital lobe) and their roles in behavior and development.
  
- **Growth Tracking:** Simulate adjustments in the brain's regions and track the resultant changes in behavior, providing users with insight into developmental neuroscience.
  
- **Behavioral Phenotype Simulation:** After adjusting the brain regions, users can witness firsthand the behavioral phenotype and see brain-stimulated behavioral activation in action.
  
- **Statistics Display:** Post-simulation, statistics for each of the simulations are displayed, offering users detailed insights into how each adjustment affected the outcome.

This project not only aims to educate but also to inspire curiosity and deeper understanding of the human brain's role in the cycle of life, providing a bridge between complex scientific concepts and accessible, interactive learning.
